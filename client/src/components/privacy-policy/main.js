        <h2> Why is there a separate Privacy Policy for Children? </h2>

          The Federal Trade Commission's Children's Online Privacy Protection
          Act ("COPPA") requires us to inform parents about how we collect, use,
          and disclose Personal Information from children under 13 years of age.{" "}
        </p>

        <h2>What kind of Personal Information is covered by COPPA?</h2>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Under COPPA, "Personal Information" is defined as individually
          identifiable information, and includes: full name (first and last); a
          home or other physical address including street name and city or town;
          online contact information such as an email address or screen name; a
          phone number; a Social Security number; a photograph, video or audio
          file containing a child's image or voice; a persistent identifier that

          such identification number is solely for the purpose of knowing the
          growth of a child from birth as they grow old to 5 years. We do not
          request, access, or retrieve any additional information. All
          information, including their personal information, is protected from

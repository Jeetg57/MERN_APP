            <h1 className="">The Problem the project addresses</h1>
            <p className="text-justify">
              In most rural areas in Kenya, access to basic child health
              services often requires a long journey to the nearest health
              facility. The cost of the journey in addition to the small fee
              charged at the health facility is out of reach for most rural, and
              financially challenged families. The net result is that many
              families in remote rural areas do not visit health facilities
              until it is too late. This means that many children in rural areas
              continue to suffer from preventable health related problems that
              would otherwise be easily monitored and addressed early.
              Consequently under-5 mortality remains unacceptably high. Child
              survival Statistics from UNICEF show that under five mortality
              rate is 46 for every 1000 births with the infant mortality rate as
              34 for every 1000 births. The problem is further compounded by the
              fact that in Kenya, there are 13.8 doctors, nurses and physicians
              for every 10,000 people, less than three times the World Health
              Organization's recommendation of 44.5.

            <h1 className="mt-3">Project Scope</h1>
            <p className="text-justify">
              The project will focus on babies (0-9 months) who need to visit
              the clinic almost every month for routine screening tests. It can
              be scaled to take care of children under 5 years. This project
              seeks to address the described challenge by providing community
              health workers and parents with portable and convenient IoT device
              that can be used to monitor growth parameters of children from
              rural or other marginalized areas. The device will communicate
              with health facilities and inform them of children who require
              immediate attention in order for them to take intervention
              measures before it is too late.

            <h1 className="mt-3">Innovative aspects of the design</h1>
            <p className="text-justify">
              The current infant screening process requires a mother to go to a
              medical facility with their baby which is inconvenient, costly and
              time consuming. It sometimes takes hours just to get to the
              facility in rural areas due to bad roads. At medical facilities a
              mother has to wait in line just to get attended, if the queue is
              to long she has to come back the next day. To address this
              challenge the current growth monitoring process limits the
              monitoring to only those times when a baby needs to be immunized.
              Monitoring growth is critical especially for preterm babies or
              babies with special needs. Such babies need close monitoring for
              timely interventions. Our proposed solution addresses this
              challenges by developing a solution to enable screening to be
              conducted remotely at the infantâ€™s home. The existing devices used
              to screen babies require skills to use, are not portable and are
              often too expensive for mothers to acquire. Thus they are only
              found in the health care facilities. In order to reduce infant
              mortality rate in rural areas and among the poor people this has
              to change. We have come up with an IoT device that is portable,
              affordable and easy to use.
